# @typhonjs-fvtt/svelte
Provides resources to integrate Svelte w/ Foundry VTT flushing out the `@typhonjs-fvtt/runtime/svelte` exports.

In building [@typhonjs-fvtt/runtime](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib/runtime) this package is integrated in
the build process extending [@typhonjs-svelte/runtime-base](https://github.com/typhonjs-svelte/runtime-base).

This repository is not designed to be used independently, but as a resource in the final Foundry VTT runtime package
build.
